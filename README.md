# raven-website

This is the base code for my personal website, created over the course of my time as a Fullstack Academy student. This document will be updated as more changes are made. Note: The changes on this document may not reflect the changes made to the main branch.

I have included an about page, a contect page, and a perfolio page. While the stylesheets and base templates for these pages are complete, the pages themselves are currently empty, consisting only of links to other pages within the site, as well as links to the home pages for a few popular social media websites (specifically Mastodon,Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, and Discord). My personal socials have not been linked, and I currently do not plan to link them.
