        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Raven Axel Alexander Phoenix (xe/xem/xeyr or they/them/their) is a 
            musician, gamer, novel writer, and fullstack web developer. Xey took 
            a mild interest in HTML at the age of seven. In March 2022, Raven 
            decided to take web development a little more seriously, and enrolled 
            in Fullstack Academy in order to expand xeyr technical skillset. Xey 
            have since learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript for basic front end 
            engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Raven spends a lot of xeyr free time writing stories and composing 
            music. In xeyr personal life, Raven tries to the best of xeyr ability 
            to exclusively use community-driven open-source software.
